My capstone project for the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone course, guided by Professor Brooke, involves refining a full-stack web application known as "Travlr Getaways." Initially created during my CS 465 Full Stack Development I course, the project centers around the development of a static customer-facing website utilizing the MEAN stack. To showcase my competencies in algorithms and data structures, I enhanced my hotel booking app with additional features such as search, filter, and sort functions for the hotels database.

This artifact is a testament to my proficiency in implementing complex algorithms and understanding data structures. It includes:

- Search and sort functions to efficiently retrieve and display hotel data based on user queries.
- Route handlers and middleware for robust user authentication.
- Backend APIs designed for dynamic hotel searches.
- Advanced components for filtering hotels by facilities, types, prices, and ratings, necessitating the use of efficient data management techniques.

The enhancements align with the course objectives, underscoring my skill in designing and implementing sophisticated algorithms and data structures within a full-stack web application context. These improvements cover the project objectives outlined in Module One, with no current updates to the outcome-coverage plans.

Reflecting on the artifact's enhancement process, I gained insight into the intricacies of algorithmic design and the importance of optimizing application performance through thoughtful data structure selection. The challenges of implementing multifaceted filtering functions brought to light the need to balance time complexity and space complexity â€” a critical aspect of algorithmic efficiency.

### Key Course Outcomes Addressed:

1. **Design and Evaluation of Computing Solutions**:
   - Employed sorting algorithms and data structures such as arrays and objects for managing hotel data, considering factors like time and space complexity.

2. **Innovative Techniques and Tools**:
   - Applied contemporary full-stack development tools and adhered to software engineering principles to ensure the application's reliability and maintainability.

3. **Security Mindset**:
   - Integrated security practices into the application design to protect against common vulnerabilities, using techniques like input sanitization and encrypted data storage.

The "Travlr.com" project not only exhibits my capabilities in computer science but also highlights my commitment to developing secure, high-quality software solutions.
